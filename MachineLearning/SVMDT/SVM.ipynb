    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used to solve nonlinear problems by leveraging a technique known as the \"kernel trick.\" This technique allows SVM to transform the original feature space into a higher-dimensional space, where the data might become linearly separable. By doing so, SVM can effectively handle complex, nonlinear relationships between features and classes.\n",
